# SharkHedwig

## Introduction
The Shark HedwigComponent is a component written for the [ASAP/Shark protocol and framework](https://github.com/SharedKnowledge/ASAPJava). 
By integrating the [SharkPKI](https://github.com/SharedKnowledge/SharkPKI.git) component, which is also part of the ASAP/Shark 
family, the component enables secure data exchange in mobile decentralized networks. This component is mainly 
used for encrypted message exchange to enable mobile transport drones to physically exchange packets.

## Quick Start
Clone the repository to your preferred local working directory. It is recommended to use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/?var=1) 
or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) just because they offer an excellent language integration.

After cloning into the project you can start by running all test cases from the ```src/test/java/TestRunner``` file.
The ```public class TestRunner {}``` suite runs all test cases automatically and gives a first insight into the workflow 
of the project.
